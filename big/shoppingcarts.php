<h2>Shopping Carts Research</h2>
    <p>An online shopping cart is the software that allows site visitors to purchase goods or services on a website (BigCommerce). You will see these on sites such as Amazon.com and they allow users to add items to the virtual cart and purchase them at the end of the shopping experience. A shopping cart has 3 basic functions in that it stores product data, is a gateway for order and customer management and it provides product data, categories and information for user display (BigCommerce). It stores data while the user is shopping and when the user is ready to check out it allows them to delete items and purchase others if they’ve changed their mind.</p>

    <p>When it’s time for a developer to choose shopping cart software it’s important that they consider what kinds of goods or services they’re selling online before choosing the software. This is because some software is a better match for selling physical items whereas other software is better matched for virtual products like ebooks or services (Martinez, 2019). Basically, it’s best to match what’s being sold with the optimum software to sell it. It’s also important to shop around to see the benefits being offered with various software packages. </p>
    
    <p>In addition to shopping carts that allow the sale of goods or services you can monetize your website in various ways to earn additional income. An example of a way to do this is affiliate marketing which means that you would find a product to recommend on your website and get paid each time someone clicks to purchase that from the site (Novoselov, 2019). If you had a site that was about a particular sport you might choose a product that is used in that sport to recommend. Another way to earn money is through Google Adsense where you would allow Google to place ads on your site and each time a user clicked on the advertising you would get paid (Novoselov, 2019).</p>
