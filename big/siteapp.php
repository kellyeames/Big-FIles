<h2>Responsive Site vs. Mobile App Research</h2>
    <p>Web design has changed dramatically with the times since its inception and will continue to do so. Most websites are now being designed responsively to give users an optimal experience when visiting the site. Mobile apps are increasing in popularity as a way to do socially connect and do business. In fact, 85% of users prefer to use a mobile device to access sites than a desktop (JetRuby, 2017). </p>

    <p>Responsiveness in web design, in particular, is important because it allows the user to have an optimum experience using it and the site is also designed so that mobile users are only seeing the most essential information (Gregory, 2019). For example, if I’m accessing a shopping site by phone the business will want to ensure that I have easy access to the shopping cart and that payment is convenient. Businesses can benefit from responsive web design because it allows an increased reach to customers using smaller devices and it provides a consistent experience that improves lead generation and an increase in sales (Gregory, 2019). </p>

    <p>When choosing to go with either responsive web design or mobile app designers and businesses have many considerations. Mobile apps can be more attractive than simply going with responsive web design. Mobile apps have faster loading times than websites, can offer greater functionality than websites and some mobile apps allow users to access them even without an internet connection (Loonars, 2019). Although it might seem initially that a business would surely prefer a mobile app over a responsive website there are some benefits websites have over mobile apps. Primarily those benefits are that launching a website takes considerably less time than a mobile app and mobile apps can be costly to create and maintain (Smashstack). </p>

    <p>Ultimately the choice between a responsive website and a mobile app come down to what the business goals are (Summerfield). A smaller business or a startup might choose to go with a responsive website in considerations of cost and time. A larger business that has access to more money might choose a mobile app or even a mobile app plus a responsive website. </p>
